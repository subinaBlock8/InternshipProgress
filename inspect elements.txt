INSPECT ELEMENTS:
Suppose we open a facebook page and we saw some images on it and if we right click and go on the inspect 
we will see a bunch of code which is in HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT. 
(SO we can say it is a tool that leads the user interact with the code)


1.Download Anything:For Eg.I go to the fb and i want to download the cover image of any random person
                    i'll go on the inspect element and then go to to div andwill find the server link 
                    of the the image and by copy it and open itin another tab then you will get an option
                    to download it.
